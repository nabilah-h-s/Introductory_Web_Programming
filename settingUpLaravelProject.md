## Create a copy of your .env file
.env files are not generally committed to source control for security reasons. But there is a .env.example which is a template of the .env file that the project expects us to have. So we will make a copy of the .env.example file and create a .env file that we can start to fill out to do things like database configuration in the next few steps.
```php
copy .env.example .env
```
## Create database from phpMyAdmin

## Generate an app encryption key
Laravel requires you to have an app encryption key which is generally randomly generated and stored in your .env file. The app will use this encryption key to encode various elements of your application from cookies to password hashes and more.

Laravelâ€™s command line tools thankfully make it super easy to generate this. In the terminal we can run this command to generate that key. (Make sure that you have already installed Laravel via composer and created an .env file before doing this, of which we have done both).
```php
php artisan Key:generate
```

```php
php artisan migrate
```

```php
php artisan db:seed
```

```php
php artisan serve
```
